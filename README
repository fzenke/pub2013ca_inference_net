This file is part of lgnet, the network simulation used in 

Lütcke, H., Gerhard, F., Zenke, F., Gerstner, W., and Helmchen, F. (2013).
Inference of neuronal network spike dynamics and topology from calcium
imaging data. Front Neural Circuits 7.
http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncir.2013.00201/abstract

To run the simulation you need a compiled version of the network simulator
Auryn,  which can be found at http://www.fzenke.net/auryn and
http://github.org/fzenke/auryn.

Note that the output files are VERY large!

To run the simulation it will suffice on most Linux systems to call 'make'
from the command line. This will unpack the time series file with the brownian
rate modulation, compile the code and run the simulation. Output files are
written to the subdirectory ./data. 

The simulation generates the following human readable files:

lgnet.0.e.prate : Firing rate of exc population
lgnet.0.i.ras : Spikes from inh population
lgnet.0.e.ras : Spikes from exc population
lgnet.0.p.ras : Spikes from Poisson population
lgnet.0.e.mem : First couple of seconds of membrane of neuron 123
lgnet.0.log : Logfile
lgnet.0.ee.wmat : Connectivity matrix E->E in MatrixMarket format 
lgnet.0.ei.wmat : Connectivity matrix E->I in MatrixMarket format 
lgnet.0.ie.wmat : Connectivity matrix I->E in MatrixMarket format 
lgnet.0.ii.wmat : Connectivity matrix I->I in MatrixMarket format 

Note that the spikes generated in this step might need further filtering as was
done in Lütcke, H., Gerhard, F., et al.

Enjoy!
